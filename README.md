![Uploading Screenshot 2024-06-09 at 17.15.26.pngâ€¦]()

My dotfiles repository! This repository contains my personal configurations for various tools and applications that I use in my development environment. Feel free to explore, use, and adapt these configurations for your own setup.

There is as well .install.sh file, which will automatically install and make macOS machine ready for development. 
Be carefuk and check content of script, cause I am disabling a lot of system settings from macOS system.

## Installation

To get started with these dotfiles, you can clone the repository to your home directory:

```bash

Then, you can symlink the configuration files to their appropriate locations. For example:

```
