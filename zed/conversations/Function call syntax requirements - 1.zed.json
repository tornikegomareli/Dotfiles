Let me explain why you might be getting a compile error.\n\nWhen using curly braces `{}` in method calls, there are specific rules:\n\n1. **Method calls require parentheses**: In most programming languages (like Java, C#, etc.), method calls must have parentheses, even if there are no parameters:\n   ```\n   myMethod();  // Correct\n   myMethod;    // Incorrect (in most languages)\n   ```\n\n2. **Curly braces inside parentheses**: When you want to use curly braces for certain parameter patterns (like in Scala, Kotlin, or other languages with lambda/closure syntax), they must be inside the parentheses:\n   ```\n   myMethod({ x => x * 2 });  // Correct\n   myMethod{ x => x * 2 };    // May be incorrect depending on language\n   ```\n\n3. **Language-specific exceptions**: Some languages like Scala allow omitting parentheses in specific circumstances, but only if the method takes exactly one argument that's a block:\n   ```scala\n   // Scala allows this\n   List(1,2,3).map { x => x * 2 }\n   ```\n\nThe specific reason for your error depends on:\n\n1. Which programming language you're using\n2. The exact method signature\n3. How you're trying to use the curly braces\n\nIf you could share the specific programming language and the code that's causing the error, I could provide a more precise explanation.\nIts Swift, and function takes as argument two closure, predicate and handler, so for syntactic sugar wanted to write like that when {  }  { } \n\nAh, now I understand! In Swift, the specific syntax rule you're encountering relates to trailing closures.\n\nHere's why you're getting a compile error:\n\nIn Swift, when a function accepts multiple closures as parameters, you can only use the trailing closure syntax (where you omit the parentheses) for the **last** parameter. When you have two closure parameters, you need to follow these rules:\n\n```swift\n// Function definition\nfunc someFunction(predicate: @escaping (Int) -> Bool, handler: @escaping (Int) -> Void) {\n    // Implementation\n}\n\n// INCORRECT usage - trying to use two trailing closures\nsomeFunction { num in num > 5 } { num in print(num) }  // Compile error!\n\n// CORRECT usage - only the last closure can be outside parentheses\nsomeFunction(predicate: { num in num > 5 }) { num in print(num) }\n```\n\nSince Swift 5.3, there is actually a syntax for multiple trailing closures, but it uses a specific format:\n\n```swift\n// Swift 5.3+ syntax for multiple trailing closures\nsomeFunction { num in \n    num > 5 \n} handler: { num in \n    print(num) \n}\n```\n\nThis new syntax explicitly labels the second (and any subsequent) trailing closures with their parameter names.\n\nSo, you either need to:\n1. Keep the first closure inside parentheses, or\n2. Use the newer Swift 5.3+ syntax with labeled trailing closures\n\nThis is a common point of confusion in Swift because the syntax for multiple closures has specific rules that differ from other parameter types.\nin zed editor ctrl -- is key binding for go back, how can I change it ?\n\nTo change the key binding for \"go back\" (ctrl-dash) in Zed editor, you'll need to modify your key bindings configuration. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Open Zed editor\n2. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)\n3. Type \"Open Key Bindings\" and select it\n4. This will open your `keymap.json` file\n\nIn this file, you can add a new key binding while removing the default one. Look for the existing binding for \"go back\" and modify it, or add a new entry like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  // Disable the default binding\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      \"ctrl--\": null\n    }\n  },\n  // Add your new preferred key binding\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      \"your-preferred-key-combo\": \"go_back\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nReplace `\"your-preferred-key-combo\"` with the key combination you prefer, such as `\"alt+left\"` or another combination that doesn't conflict with existing bindings.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding the exact command name for \"go back\", you can:\n1. Search in the existing bindings for \"-\" or \"go_back\"\n2. Check Zed's documentation for the complete list of commands\n\nAfter saving the file, your new key binding should take effect immediately.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":223}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":26},"start":111,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":224}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":1486,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":225}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":114},"start":1630,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":226}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":115},"start":3090,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":227}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":192},"start":3163,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":228}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":193},"start":4384,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":229}}}],"summary":"Function call syntax requirements","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
