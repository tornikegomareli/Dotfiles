Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open Zed editor\n2. Open the Command Palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)\n3. Type \"Open Key Bindings\" and select it\n4. In the keybindings.json file, add or modify the binding:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cmd-delta\": \"pane::GoBack\",\n  \"ctrl-o\": null  // This will unbind the ctrl-o shortcut\n}\n```\n\nNote: If `delta` refers to the scroll wheel or some other special key, you might need to use the correct syntax for it. In Zed's keybinding system:\n\n- If by \"delta\" you mean the down arrow key, use `cmd-down`\n- If you mean the scroll wheel, the syntax might be something like `cmd-wheel-down` (though check the Zed documentation for the exact syntax)\n\nIf \"delta\" is a custom key or has a specific meaning in your setup, you may need to refer to Zed's documentation for the correct key identifier.\nnot delta just cmd `\n\nThank you for the clarification. To change the keybinding in Zed editor from `ctrl-o` to `cmd+\\`` (Command + backtick) for the `pane::GoBack` command, you need to modify your keybindings.json file as follows:\n\n1. Open Zed editor\n2. Open the Command Palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)\n3. Type \"Open Key Bindings\" and select it\n4. In the keybindings.json file, add or modify the binding:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cmd-`\": \"pane::GoBack\",\n  \"ctrl-o\": null  // This will unbind the ctrl-o shortcut\n}\n```\n\nThis will bind the Command + backtick (`) key combination to the GoBack command and remove the ctrl-o binding.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":116}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":127,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":117}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":1115,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":118}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":98},"start":1137,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":119}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":99},"start":1771,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":120}}}],"summary":"Changing keybinding for GoBack function","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
